Here are a few long tracks to test. I don't know if all the distractor are taken into account since they are set at a lot of places but appear only once in the visualiser.

The maximum possible profit is around 300

Note: the "Bois de Chaux" track is impossible to win and should not be selected ;)

Enjoy
